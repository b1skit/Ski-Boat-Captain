# Ski-Boat-Captain
Ski Boat Captain is a top-down boat racing and water ski trick-attack game set in 1980's neon-Miami, created for Android and PC using Unity. Players tow a water-skier behind their boat as they race against time to achieve the top spot on the score board. I created this game in my spare time so that I could learn more about Unity, C#, HLSL shaders, and mobile development.

This project is a work-in-progress, so please keep in mind that the art is not final and there are some bugs in the game.

Check out the .cs files in /Assets/ if you're interested in viewing the bulk of the C# sourcecode written for this project.
